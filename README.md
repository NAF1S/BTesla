## Getting started

```bash
npm install                        # installs workspace deps (client + server)
npm run db:up                      # start PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS 3.5 (docker compose)
cp client/.env.local.example client/.env.local
cp server/.env.example server/.env
npm run db:migrate                 # apply server/db/*.sql (creates the PostGIS extension)
npm run db:seed                    # apply the demo zones, points and routing graph
npm run dev                        # starts Express (:4000) and Next.js (:3000) together
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the home page calls `GET /api/health` (API + database status) and `GET /api/users`.

The container runs `server/db/*.sql` automatically the first time its volume is created. To re-apply them at any point, run `npm run db:migrate` (the SQL is idempotent).

## Scripts (run from the repo root)

| Script                 | Description                                     |

| `npm test`           | API unit + integration tests (needs the database) |

## Database

PostgreSQL 17 runs via `docker-compose.yml`:

| Setting         | Value                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database        | `TeslaB`                                              |
| User / password | `postgres` / `postgres`                             |
| Host port       | **`55432`** (container port 5432)               |
| Connection URL  | `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/TeslaB` |

> **Why port 55432?** This machine already has a local PostgreSQL service on `5432` and another container on `5433`. Override with `POSTGRES_PORT` in a root `.env` (see `.env.example`) and update `DATABASE_URL` in `server/.env` to match.

### PostGIS prerequisite

The database image is **`postgis/postgis:17-3.5`**, not plain `postgres`. PostGIS is required because the location foundation stores real spatial types (`geography(Point, 4326)` and `geometry(LineString, 4326)`); the plain image has no PostGIS shared library, so `CREATE EXTENSION postgis` would fail on it.

```bash
npm run db:up        # pull + start the PostGIS container
npm run db:migrate   # 05-postgis-location.sql runs CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis
```

- **Already had the old container running?** Recreate it so the new image is picked up: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate db`. The `teslab-pgdata` volume is PostgreSQL 17 either way, so existing data survives.
- **Privileges.** Enabling PostGIS needs a role that may create extensions. The compose database runs as the superuser `postgres`, so this works out of the box; on a managed PostgreSQL service the extension is usually enabled from the provider's console instead, and the migration statement then becomes a no-op.
- **pgRouting is deliberately not installed.** This phase stores a graph; pathfinding is a later phase.

### ORM (Prisma)

All database access goes through **Prisma**. `server/src/db/prisma.js` exports the single client, built on the official `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter (which Prisma 7 requires for PostgreSQL). Services use Prisma models rather than hand-written SQL, and error handling maps both Prisma error codes (`P2002` → 409, `P2025` → 404) and the SQLSTATEs Prisma nests inside raw-SQL errors, so the 400/404/409 contract is unchanged.

The relationship between Prisma and the SQL files is deliberate:

- **`server/db/*.sql` remains the source of truth for the physical schema.** `server/prisma/schema.prisma` was produced by introspecting it (`prisma db pull`) and maps onto the existing snake_case tables and columns with `@@map`/`@map`, so renaming a Prisma model does not rename a table.
- **`prisma migrate` is intentionally not used.** Prisma does not model `CHECK` constraints or PostGIS types, so handing it ownership of migrations would try to drop constraints such as `routing_edges_no_self_loop` and the GiST spatial indexes. Migrations stay hand-written and are applied by `npm run db:migrate`, which executes each file through Prisma, one transaction per file.
- **Spatial columns are `Unsupported("geography")` / `Unsupported("geometry")` in the Prisma schema**, because Prisma has no PostGIS types. Reading or writing a coordinate therefore goes through parameterised raw SQL (`src/services/location.service.js`, `src/db/seeds/location.seed.js`), not the Prisma client.
- `DATABASE_URL` is resolved by `server/src/config/env.js` for both the API and the Prisma CLI (`prisma7.config.ts` imports that module), so the two cannot drift apart and the API still runs with no `.env` file at all.

To check that the Prisma view still matches the live database:

```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate diff --from-config-datasource --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script
```

An empty migration is the ideal result. Two things will show up as intended differences, and neither is drift to "fix":

1. the GiST spatial indexes, which Prisma cannot express on an `Unsupported` column, so it always proposes dropping them;
2. any leftover object from a database that predates the current migration files -- for example a table created by a migration that has since been removed. The database in this workspace has some of these from an earlier, abandoned branch; `npm run db:reset` gives a clean database built only from the files in `server/db`.

Like `pg_typeof()`, a few PostgreSQL internals cannot be read through Prisma raw queries; cast them (`pg_typeof(x)::text`) when you need them.

Schema (`server/db/01-schema.sql`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id         UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name       TEXT NOT NULL,
  email      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Postgres errors are translated to HTTP responses in `server/src/middleware/errorHandler.js` — e.g. a duplicate email (`23505`) becomes `409`.

### PostGIS location tables (`server/db/05-postgis-location.sql`)

| Table              | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `service_zones`    | The 15 Dhaka zones; unique `code` **and** unique `name`, `active`, `geography(Point, 4326)` centre |
| `service_points`   | Curated pickup/drop-off places; globally unique `code`, `geography(Point, 4326)` location, one zone and one routing vertex |
| `routing_vertices` | Graph nodes; unique `code`, `geometry(Point, 4326)` location                     |
| `routing_edges`    | Directed graph edges; `geometry(LineString, 4326)`, measured distance, normal/rush durations, fare weight |

Design notes:

- `code` is the stable seed key on every table, which is why a zone's display `name` can change without breaking anything that references it.
- `service_points.user_id`-style uniqueness: `(zone_id, name)` is unique, so a zone cannot list the same place twice, and `code` is globally unique.
- `service_points.routing_vertex_id` is `NOT NULL`, so a point can never exist without a graph node. The tables were created empty, so no two-phase backfill was needed.
- `routing_edges` rejects self-loops, requires at least two points of geometry, keeps `distance_meters` equal to `ST_Length(geometry::geography)`, requires `rush_hour >= normal`, and enforces that the reverse-duration columns are present **exactly** when `bidirectional` is true.
- GiST spatial indexes exist on all four geometry/geography columns; the graph also has indexes on source, target, active and code.
- `updated_at` is maintained by a shared `set_updated_at()` trigger; internal timestamps are never returned by the API.

> **Note on the coordinate range checks.** A `geography` value in SRID 4326 is *normalised* on input: casting an out-of-range point does not raise, it is silently corrected (latitude 95 becomes 85, longitude 190 becomes −170). The range checks on the geography columns therefore document what is stored rather than rejecting a bad input. Rejecting an out-of-range coordinate happens **before** the cast, in `server/src/utils/geo.js`. The range checks on `routing_vertices.location` (plain `geometry`, which does *not* normalise) are real and do fire. A test pins this behaviour.

## API

Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api`

| Method   | Endpoint                     | Description                                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/health`                  | Service status, uptime, and database probe                                            |
| `GET`  | `/users`                   | List users                                                                            |
| `GET`  | `/users/:id`               | Get a single user (`404` if missing)                                                |
| `POST` | `/users`                   | Create a user (**ADMIN only**) — body: `{ "name", "email" }`                |
| `POST` | `/auth/register`           | Sign up as PASSENGER or DRIVER; signs in — body: `{ "name", "email", "password", "role"? }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/login`              | Log in; sets the HttpOnly auth cookie — body: `{ "email", "password" }`      |
| `GET`  | `/auth/me`                 | Current user (requires authentication)                                                |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout`             | Clear the auth cookie (safe to retry)                                                 |
| `GET`  | `/location/zones`          | List the 15 active service zones                                                      |
| `GET`  | `/location/points`         | List active service points, optional `?zoneCode=`                                   |
| `GET`  | `/location/points/:code`   | Get one service point by code                                                         |

The location endpoints are read-only and return DTOs (`server/src/serializers/location.serializer.js`) instead of raw rows, so database column names, routing vertices and audit timestamps never leak into responses. They are the **only** location endpoints: there is deliberately no route, distance, ETA, quote, fare, ride or matching endpoint in this phase.

Codes are stable machine-readable values (lower-case letters, digits, `-` and `_`). Input is trimmed and lower-cased, so `?zoneCode=BANANI` works.

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "…", "code": "banani-road-11", "name": "Banani Road 11", "zoneCode": "banani", "latitude": 23.7937, "longitude": 90.4043 }
  ]
}
```

Status codes are consistent across the location endpoints:

| Status | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Missing, malformed or unsupported query parameter                        |
| `401`  | Credentials rejected, or no valid authentication (auth endpoints)        |
| `403`  | Authenticated, but not permitted for this role                           |
| `404`  | Unknown zone or point code                                               |
| `409`  | The record exists but is inactive (also used for database conflicts)    |

`/health` reports `"ok"` when the database is reachable and `"degraded"` when it is not, and never fails the request:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 23.6,
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T18:47:05.740Z",
  "database": { "status": "up", "latencyMs": 2 }
}
```

Errors use a consistent shape:

```json
{ "error": { "message": "User 99 not found" } }
```

## Authentication

Authentication is a **signed JWT carried in an HttpOnly cookie**. There is no server-side session store, and nothing is ever put in `localStorage`.

### Why this design

- The browser only ever talks to the same origin — `next.config.mjs` proxies `/api/*` to Express — so `SameSite=Lax` is sufficient and no CSRF token is needed.
- The cookie is `HttpOnly`, so JavaScript (and therefore any XSS payload) cannot read the token.
- The token payload carries **only the user id**. It deliberately never carries the role or the profile, because nothing in the token is trusted for authorization: `requireAuth` re-loads the user from the database on every request. A deactivated account, a deleted account or a changed role therefore takes effect on the very next request instead of at token expiry.

### Signing up

`POST /auth/register` creates an account and signs it in immediately, using the same HttpOnly cookie as login. It returns `201`.

| Field        | Required | Notes                                                                       |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | yes      | Trimmed; must not be blank                                                  |
| `email`    | yes      | The login identifier; trimmed and lower-cased before storage                |
| `password` | yes      | At least 8 characters, at most 72 bytes (bcrypt's input limit)              |
| `role`     | no       | `PASSENGER` (default) or `DRIVER`. **`ADMIN` is not accepted.** |

- A `PASSENGER` is created with a passenger profile; a `DRIVER` is created with a driver profile that starts `OFFLINE` and has no vehicle, so a self-registered driver cannot be matched until a vehicle exists.
- **`ADMIN` can never be self-selected.** It is not an accepted value for `role`, so a client cannot promote itself by adding a field to the body — the attempt is simply a `400`. Admins are created by an existing admin through `POST /api/users`.
- An email that is already registered returns `409`, including a case variant, because the identifier is normalised before it is stored.

```bash
curl -i -c cookies.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Ayesha","email":"ayesha@example.com","password":"BrandNewPass1!","role":"DRIVER"}' \
  http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register
```

> **Known trade-off.** Because sign-up reports that an email is already registered, this endpoint can be used to probe whether an account exists. Login deliberately does not leak that. The usual fix is to accept the request and confirm by email instead, which needs the email-verification flow that is not built yet (see Next steps).

### Demo accounts

Seeded by `npm run db:seed`. **Development/demo only — never seed these in production.**

| Actor  | Email                  | Role          | Profile / vehicle                         |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Nusrat | `nusrat@example.com` | `PASSENGER` | Passenger profile                         |
| Rafiq  | `rafiq@example.com`  | `PASSENGER` | Passenger profile                         |
| Shirin | `shirin@example.com` | `PASSENGER` | Passenger profile                         |
| Jashim | `jashim@example.com` | `DRIVER`    | Driver profile + vehicle Bullet (3 seats) |

The demo password is **not** stored in the repository. Every demo account is given the value of `DEMO_SEED_PASSWORD` (default `DemoPass123!`), hashed with bcrypt before it reaches the database. To change it, set `DEMO_SEED_PASSWORD` in `server/.env` and re-run the seed.

> **Production warning.** The seeder refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production` unless `ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=true`, and even then it requires `DEMO_SEED_PASSWORD` to be set explicitly. The server separately refuses to start in production without `JWT_SECRET`.

### Example requests

```bash
# Log in. The token is returned only as a Set-Cookie, never in the body.
curl -i -c cookies.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"nusrat@example.com","password":"DemoPass123!"}' \
  http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login

# Current user
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:4000/api/auth/me

# Log out (safe to retry)
curl -i -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/logout
```

Successful login and current-user responses:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "…",
    "name": "Nusrat",
    "role": "PASSENGER",
    "active": true,
    "passengerProfile": { "id": "…" }
  }
}
```

Jashim's response carries `driverProfile` instead, including the active vehicle summary:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "…",
    "name": "Jashim",
    "role": "DRIVER",
    "active": true,
    "driverProfile": {
      "id": "…",
      "status": "OFFLINE",
      "vehicles": [{ "id": "…", "name": "Bullet", "seatCapacity": 3 }]
    }
  }
}
```

Only the profile belonging to the role is returned: `passengerProfile` for a passenger, `driverProfile` for a driver, and neither for an admin. `passwordHash` and the audit timestamps are never part of the response — `server/src/serializers/user.serializer.js` builds its output as a whitelist, so a new column cannot leak by accident.

### Authentication errors

| Status  | Meaning                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400` | Missing or malformed credentials, or an unsupported body field |
| `401` | Credentials rejected, or no valid authentication               |
| `403` | Authenticated, but not permitted for this role                 |

Every rejected login returns the same `401` with the same message, so a caller cannot tell an unknown account from a wrong password. Validation errors never echo the submitted password.

### Authorization

`server/src/middleware/auth.js` is the reusable foundation:

- `requireAuth` — loads the user from the database and rejects inactive or deleted accounts.
- `requireRole('ADMIN')` — role guard; must be mounted after `requireAuth`.
- `currentUser(req)` — the authenticated user attached to the request.

`POST /api/users` is gated with `requireRole(Role.ADMIN)`. That is both a real use of the guard and what stops a client from choosing `ADMIN` when creating an account. The read endpoints (`GET /api/users`) are still public so the Next.js demo page keeps working; tightening them is a follow-up once the client can send the cookie.

Authorization is always decided on the server from the database record. Hiding routes in the front end is not authorization.

## How the client talks to the API

- The browser requests `/api/...` on the Next.js origin; `next.config.mjs` rewrites those calls to the Express server (`API_PROXY_TARGET`, default `http://localhost:4000`). No CORS round-trip needed in the browser.
- Server components use `API_URL` from `client/.env.local` because relative URLs cannot be fetched on the server.
- Direct cross-origin calls still work — the API sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for `CLIENT_ORIGIN`.

## Location and routing graph demo data

```bash
npm run db:up        # PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS 3.5
npm run db:migrate   # create/refresh the schema, including postgis (idempotent)
npm run db:seed      # apply the demo zones, points and routing graph (idempotent)

After seeding you get **15 service zones, 45 service points, 45 routing vertices and 46 routing edges** (42 bidirectional, 4 one-way).

> **Every coordinate is approximate demo data, not verified navigation data.** The MVP deliberately has no maps, geocoding, routing APIs or live traffic. `server/src/db/seeds/location.data.js` holds hand-written, neighbourhood-level coordinates for each named Dhaka location, and each edge is a straight two-point LineString between the coordinates it connects -- plausible for a demo, not a road centreline. Edit that one file to review or change any of it, then re-run `npm run db:seed`.

### ServicePoint vs RoutingVertex

They are deliberately separate models:

- a **ServicePoint** is passenger-facing: a curated place someone can later be picked up from or dropped at. It belongs to exactly one zone and has a stable, globally unique `code`.
- a **RoutingVertex** is a graph node: what a future router walks between. It carries no passenger-facing meaning.

In this seed they are one-to-one, which keeps the graph easy to reason about; the separation is what will later allow several service points to share one junction. `ServicePoint.routingVertexId` is `NOT NULL`, so a point can never exist without a vertex.

### Coordinate conventions

- Everything is **WGS84 / SRID 4326**.
- **Longitude comes first** in every PostGIS constructor: `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)`. Reversing them is not an error PostGIS reports -- it silently stores a point somewhere else on the planet. Nothing in this codebase builds spatial SQL by hand: `server/src/utils/geo.js` is the single place the order is decided, and it only accepts a named `{ latitude, longitude }` pair, so the two cannot be passed positionally by mistake.
- Coordinates are validated in the application **before** the cast: latitude within ±90, longitude within ±180, and -- for this seed -- inside the generous Dhaka box defined in `geo.js`.

### RoutingEdge: distance, direction and durations

| Column | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `distanceMeters` | Measured from the geometry with `ST_Length(geometry::geography)`. Never hand-written, and a `CHECK` keeps the two in step, so an edge cannot claim a length its shape does not have. |
| `normalDurationSeconds` | Derived from the measured distance at `DEMO_SPEED_KMH.normal` (a demo 24 km/h). |
| `rushHourDurationSeconds` | Same, at the demo 14 km/h. A `CHECK` enforces `rush_hour >= normal`, so rush hour can never come out faster. |
| `fareWeight` | A relative weight for a later phase. **It is not a fare, and no money is stored on an edge.** Defaults to 1; the seed includes 1.5 and 0.75 examples. |

Direction rules:

- a directed edge always permits travel **source → target**;
- `bidirectional = true` adds the return leg, so the `reverse*DurationSeconds` columns **must** be present;
- `bidirectional = false` has no return leg, so those columns **must** be NULL.

One `CHECK` enforces both cases, and self-loop edges are rejected. The seed sets the reverse duration equal to the forward one, because a single geometry describes the pair; the columns exist so a later phase can encode genuinely asymmetric traffic.

### Graph validation

The seed validates before it commits and rolls the whole transaction back if anything is wrong, in this order: zones → vertices → points → edges → coordinate bounds → edge geometry and endpoints → graph connectivity.

Connectivity is checked with a recursive CTE: no isolated vertex, every zone touches another zone, and all vertices form one weakly connected component. That is a data-integrity check, **not** pathfinding.

To verify the stored graph yourself:

```bash
npm run test:integration --workspace server
```

### What is deliberately deferred

This phase stores and validates a graph. It does **not** implement pgRouting, Dijkstra/A*, a routing service, route quotes, distance or ETA APIs, fare calculation, ride requests, ride events, pools, pool membership, matching, driver assignment or seat reservation. Pathfinding and every routing API are a later phase.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                        # everything
npm run test:unit --workspace server
npm run test:integration --workspace server
```

Tests use Node's built-in runner (`node --test`) — no extra dependencies. The integration suites run against the real PostgreSQL database from `DATABASE_URL`, apply `server/db/*.sql` and the seed themselves, and clean up after themselves; the database must be reachable (`npm run db:up`). Constraint tests run inside rolled-back transactions.

Coverage highlights: the PostGIS extension and the real spatial column types; the GiST spatial indexes; that coordinates are stored longitude-first; `ST_DWithin` proximity answering in metres with a distant point correctly excluded; the seed totals, per-zone point counts, correct zone membership and idempotency; the coordinate bounds; and -- for the graph -- no isolated vertex, one weakly connected component, every zone linked to another, edge endpoints aligned with their vertices, edge distance matching `ST_Length`, and the direction / duration / fare-weight invariants. It also asserts that the superseded `/api/transport/*` endpoints are gone and that no routing, quote, fare or ride endpoint has appeared.

## Next steps

- Decide how schema changes are reviewed now that Prisma is in place: keep the idempotent `server/db/*.sql` files as the source of truth (the current setup, and what preserves the `CHECK` constraints and GiST indexes Prisma cannot model), or move fully to Prisma Migrate and express those another way.
- Authenticate the client: send the auth cookie from the Next.js app, then tighten `GET /api/users`, which is still public so the demo page keeps rendering.
- Build the routing phase on top of the stored graph: pgRouting (or an in-process algorithm), route quotes, distance/ETA and fare calculation. None of that exists yet -- the graph is stored and validated only.
- Add email verification and password reset. Sign-up currently accepts any address a caller supplies, so nobody proves they own the email they register with.
- Rate-limit `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register`. No limiter is installed yet, so password guessing and bulk sign-ups are unthrottled.
- JWT logout cannot revoke a token before it expires. Add a token denylist (or move to opaque server-side sessions) if immediate revocation becomes a requirement.
- Add validation (e.g. `zod`) for request bodies once write endpoints exist.
- Add Playwright coverage for the client.
